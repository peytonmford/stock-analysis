# An Analysis for Stocks, 2017-2018
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to compare stocks from 2017 and 2018. Comparing stocks from multiple years gives a clear understanding of how that stock did in the past and how it can possibly do in the future. By comparing multiple stocks gives a clear understanding to the user of the different industries and how they preform, so when deciding to invest in stocks, you can have an understanding of what industries are doing better than others.

## Results
The results of this analysis was comparing the Total Volumes and Return of each stock ticker. When running the refactored code, you can see that just a year difference had drastic total volume and return values. When refactoring the code, we decided to use an Index to reference the tickers; with adding the Index, we can see that the time it took to run the code with much faster with refactoring.
